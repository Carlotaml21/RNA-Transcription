# RNA Interference (RNAi) - Targeted Therapy Project

## Overview
You work for a bioengineering company that specializes in developing therapeutic solutions. Your team has been assigned a new project: developing a targeted therapy for a rare type of cancer.

One of the core challenges is that excessive production of certain proteins can lead to disease. Our approach involves designing a specific molecule called **micro-RNA**, which can prevent the overproduction of these proteins by interfering with their synthesis.

This technique is known as **[RNA Interference (RNAi)](https://admin.acceleratingscience.com/ask-a-scientist/what-is-rnai/)**.

## Objective
Your task is to determine the RNA complement of a given DNA sequence. This transcription process is fundamental to our RNAi-based therapy.

## Background
DNA and RNA strands consist of sequences of nucleotides:
- **DNA Nucleotides:** Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G), Thymine (T)
- **RNA Nucleotides:** Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G), Uracil (U) (replaces Thymine)

When transcribing a DNA strand into RNA, each nucleotide is replaced by its complement:
- **G → C**
- **C → G**
- **T → A**
- **A → U**

## Implementation
You will develop a program that takes a DNA strand as input and outputs its transcribed RNA sequence, following the nucleotide mapping rules above.

This project is a key step in designing micro-RNAs that can regulate protein expression for targeted cancer therapies.
